# generative art

This is not a thematically or temporarily consistent series, or maybe this is not even a series at all. Thus is the post-conceptual nature of generative art. Inspiration strikes every once in a while and what consumes me for the next few hours or days or weeks is the process of sculpting an automatic process that repeats and rapidly transforms a set of random inputs into an aesthetically pleasing whole.

Most of the experience of my generative art remains exclusive and exists in that process of creation and staring at the creation, what I can share here is just static snapshots.

-   Some of the tools I use:
    -   [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org/)
    -   [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
    -   [cables.gl](https://cables.gl/)
