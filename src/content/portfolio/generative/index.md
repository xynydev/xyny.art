            alt: "a very light pastel red ring with a slightly bolder orange circle inside it, in the vague shape of an eye. the colors are spilling out onto the canvas in a textured way, and so is the canvas spilling onto the shapes creating some darker blueish accents on the edges of the shapes."

            alt: "a bright hellish red ring with a slightly darker orange circle inside it, in the vague shape of an eye. the colors are spilling out onto the canvas creating a purple trail, and so is the canvas spilling onto the shapes creating some darker accents on the edges of the shapes."

            alt: "an abstract piece with a field of colors, some parts are very noise and others are silky smooth. this one has a small smooth dark orange-purple portion on the top left, and a smooth but strong wave pattern on the right with a gorgeus orange glow, with most of the rest of the canvas being a coarse mix of magenta and light blue"

            alt: "abstract geometric shapes overlaid and repeated, each with a white outline and a dark transparent fill. there is a visible repetion deep into the center of the canvas, which has a black border; one can see a shape right on the edge and trace it repeating directly towards the center of the image. most of the background of the image is overtaken by a gray texture filled with vague lines repeating the exact same arrangement of shapes in different positions and rotations."

            alt: "clearly visible geomtric shapes in white with black outlines; squares, circles, and triangles. there is still a centrla deep repetation and the emergence of a dark texture in the deeper parts of the image. some shapes have additional purple and yellowish glows."

            alt: "a canvas almost entirely filled with an almost organic dark gray texture with a lighter gray background and some darker gray dots that look almost like cells. some speckles of white here and there, showcasing the repetion in the image, corners of shapes with white fills and black outlines."

# generative art

This is not a thematically or temporarily consistent series, or maybe this is not even a series at all. Thus is the post-conceptual nature of generative art. Inspiration strikes every once in a while and what consumes me for the next few hours or days or weeks is the process of sculpting an automatic process that repeats and rapidly transforms a set of random inputs into an aesthetically pleasing whole.

Most of the experience of my generative art remains exclusive and exists in that process of creation and staring at the creation, what I can share here is just static snapshots.

-   Some of the tools I use:
    -   [OPENRNDR](https://openrndr.org/)
    -   [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
    -   [cables.gl](https://cables.gl/)
