# mem()ry^^fault

This is a very broad series of heavily manipulated digital images, exploring the textures both in the source images themselves, but also digital brushes. Source images can be anything, from grainy images taken with my phone, to screenshots, to 3D renders, to stock photos. All works contain some parts of the source image, sometimes recognizable (at least when being presented with the source image), and sometimes warped so much as to entirely unrecognizable. I identify this series to exist within the broader landscapes of glitch art, abstract art, net art and media art.

Most works in this series have been made with [Procreate](https://procreate.com/ipad), where its selection of brushes and filters and its other unique parts serve as a limiting factor and a source of inspiration for the works. A subset of this series has been made with [Krita](https://krita.org/), often showcasing a recognizably different style while following the same ethos. The source images of the works using Krita differ too, often being 2000s clip art or magazine cutouts.

I sometimes post works from this series to Mastodon under the tag [#mem_ry__fault](https://mastodon.art/tags/mem_ry__fault) with more in-depth alt-text.
